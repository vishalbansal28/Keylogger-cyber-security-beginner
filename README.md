# Keylogger

Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. 

Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.


# How Keystroke Logging Works

Keystroke logging is an act of tracking and recording every keystroke entry made on a computer, often without the permission or knowledge of the user. A “keystroke” is just any interaction you make with a button on your keyboard.

Keystrokes are how you “speak” to your computers. Each keystroke transmits a signal that tells your computer programs what you want them to do.

These commands may include:

    Length of the keypress
    Time of keypress
    Velocity of keypress
    Name of the key used

# Keylogger Script 

This script captures keystrokes by executing the python script and sends the email with the keystrokes

# How it works

1) Install Python (latest Version) 
2) Install Python Libraries (Required)
3) Enter the parameter mentioned in the scripts
4) Run the keylogger.py script first using the comamnd  -> python3 keylogger.py
5) Execute Zlogger Script using the command     -> python3 zlogger.py
